Firewall

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a security perimeter that helps prevent unauthorized access, monitor communication, and allow or block data transmission based on a set of predetermined security rules.

Firewalls can operate at different layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, including the network layer, transport layer, and application layer. They can be implemented as hardware devices, software applications, or a combination of both. Firewalls use various methods to control and filter network traffic, including packet filtering, stateful inspection, proxy servers, and deep packet inspection.

Key functions of a firewall include:

Packet Filtering: Examining packets of data and allowing or blocking them based on predefined rules.

Stateful Inspection: Keeping track of the state of active connections and making decisions based on the context of the traffic.

Proxying: Acting as an intermediary between a user's device and the destination server, forwarding requests and responses on behalf of the user.

Network Address Translation (NAT): Modifying network address information in packet headers as they pass through the firewall, to hide internal network details.

Logging and Reporting: Keeping records of network activity for monitoring, analysis, and auditing purposes.
